# Device

STM32F401CCCUx microcontroller. This microcontroller has:

- A Cortex-M4F core that includes a single precision FPU

- 256 KiB of Flash located at address 0x0800_0000.

- 64 KiB of RAM located at address 0x2000_0000.

``` toml
[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
```

``` console
$ cat memory.x
/* Linker script for the STM32F303VCT6 */
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 40K
}
